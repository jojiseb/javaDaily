Stack And Heap Memory

Stack Memory:
    --> employs a static memory allocation scheme, storing function calls,
        method-specific primitive data, and object references (reference variables).
    --> Access is in LIFO order.
    --> Stack memory has fixed size, doesn't change during execution.
    --> allocated to each thread dynamically during run-time.
    --> Allocation happens during thread creation, following LIFO
    --> Lifespan depends on duration of function, it ceases to exist when function concludes.

Heap Memory:
    --> facilitates dynamic memory allocation for Java Objects and JRE classes during
        program execution.
    --> Objects in heap have global access, available from any part of application.
