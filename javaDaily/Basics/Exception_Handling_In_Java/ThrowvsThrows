Throw
- To throw an exception explicitly, by the programmer.
-The flow of execution of program immediately stops after throw statement is executed
 and nearest try block is checked to see if it has a catch block that matches the type of exception
-It tries to find all catch blocks until it finds a proper handler, else it transfers control to default handler
 which halts the program flow

Throws
-Used in method signature, which might be right But,aren't handled within it.
-Listing that a particular method might throw these exceptions.
