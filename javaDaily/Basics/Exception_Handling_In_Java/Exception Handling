What ??
    - Mechanism to handle unwanted interruptions like exceptions &
      continue with normal flow of program.
    - JVM by default handle exceptions by stopping the execution of the program
      and throw the exception.

How are they handled ??
    - Java uses try-catch blocks, keywords like final, finally, throw & throws
      to handle exceptions.

Why handle exceptions ??
    - To make sure program executes properly, without any halt.
    - It is necessary to handle them whenever they occur, during compile-time
      and run-time, for smooth execution of program.
    - Even minor exceptions are left out without handling, can cause the program to terminate abruptly.


Case without exception handling :

    Eg: If a program is executing some lines of code, exception occurs mid-way.
        Program stops execution then and there without executing rest of code.

When exception is handled :

    Exception is explicitly handled and program will be executed until the end of code.
