    Java exceptions raised during program flow are nothing but objects of respective
    exception class. Each exceptions in java have a naming and inheritance hierarchy to the main exception
    class in java - Throwable class.

    Since, All exception classes support toString() method, the name of the exception class is returned as output in command prompt,
    which makes it helpful to understand the exception condition.

    Whenever an exception occurs inside a method, then the name of exception class, description is send to JVM. And the exception object
    is further handled by JVM

    When an exception is occurred, there will be an ordered list of methods that have been called to reach to the point of code causing
    the exception. This list of methods is Call Stack.

    JVM searches through the call stack to get the proper code to handle the exception occurred. This code block is called Exception Handler.
    When the handler is found, JVM handles exception according to code in handler and shows state of program.
