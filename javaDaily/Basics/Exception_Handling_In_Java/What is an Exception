What ??
    - Unwanted conditions that disrupt the flow of the program
    - Some reasons for exception:
      --> User entered invalid data
      --> File that needs to be opened isn't found
      --> Network connection lost in middle of communication, JVM m/y runs out.

Types :
    1. Checked
    2. Unchecked
    3. Errors


 Checked Exception:
    Exceptions that are checked by compiler for smooth execution of program at run-time, whether programmer handled it or not.
    Checked exceptions should be handled by the programmer. These are kind of a checking for the expected, whether programmer
    is handling it or not.

    Real-world analogies :

    --> Parents checking for Hall-ticket before leaving for examination.
    --> Parents checking for having working pens to write exam.

    Eg: FileNotFoundException, InterruptedException
