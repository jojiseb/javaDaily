--> Packages in java adds another dimension to access-control.

--> Both classes and packages are a means of data encapsulation.

--> Packages acts as containers for Classes, Classes act as containers for data and code.

Types of accessibility possible when using packages:

-Anything declared public can be accessed from anywhere.
-Anything declared private can be seen only within that class.
-If access specifier is not specified, an element is visible to subclasses, as well as other classes in same package.
-Anything declared protected, can be seen outside current package, only to classes that sub-class your class directly.

This way, Access-Control is provided to classes.
