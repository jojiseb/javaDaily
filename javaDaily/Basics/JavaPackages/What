  >  Package in java is a mechanism to encapsulate:
        --> a group of classes
        --> sub packages
        --> Interfaces

   > Used to avoid naming conflicts
            There can be 2 classes with  Employee in two packages, college.staff.cse.Employee and
            college.staff.ee.Employee
   > Makes searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier
   > To Provide controlled access
            Protected & Default have package level access control
            Protected member is accessible by classes in same package and its sub-classes
            Default member(one without any access specifier) is accessible by classes in same package
   > Package can be considered as Data Encapsulation



   We basically put related classes into packages. After that, We simply write an import class from existing packages,
   to use in our program

   Package is a container of related classes where some of classes are accessible are exposed
   and others are kept for internal purpose.

   Package names and directory structures are closely related.
   Eg : Package name - college.staff.cse , Then cse is present in staff and staff is inside college directory.
        Also directory college is accessible through classPath variable. Idea is to make sure that classes are easy to locate.

   Packages are named in reverse order of domain names : org.geeksforgeeks.practice
   Eg: college.tech.cse, college.tech.ee, college.art.history etc.
