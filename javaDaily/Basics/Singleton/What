Singleton Class
    A blueprint which ensures only one instance of a class created throughout lifetime of an application.
    No matter how many times, you try to create a new object from a singleton class, you'll always
    get the same instance that was created initially.

    So, Singleton ensures that only a single object for a class throughout the program.

    Singletons help control access to shared resources and maintain consistency across the program.

    Eg: DB Connection

    You only want a single connection to be made to DB. So, Only a single object creation
    In this case, you create a singleton class. In case of this, no matter from where it is called,
    or, how many times it is called, 1 and only 1 object is created and returned when in need.

    Ways to create Singleton Class:

    --> Eager Initialization
    --> Lazy Initialization
