An anonymous class is a local class without a name that can be used to define
and instantiate a class simultaneously.

It means it must be defined withing another class, making it a nested class without a name.
Also called as Anonymous Inner Class

An anonymous class has no name and produces only a single object.

Anonymous class can be useful for providing quick implementations of interfaces, abstract classes
in situations where creating a named class is lengthy or cumbersome.
