Whenever a variable is declared static, this means there is only one copy of it for the entire class,
rather than each of instance having its own copy.

A static method means it can be called without creating an instance/object of the class.

A Static method can only access a static data like static variables, static methods.

Advantages of Static Variables and Methods:

--> Memory Efficiency
--> Global Access
--> Object Independence
--> Performance
--> Code Organization
