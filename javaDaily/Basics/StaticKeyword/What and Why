Whenever a variable is declared static, this means there is only one copy of it for the entire class,
rather than each of instance having its own copy.

A static method means it can be called without creating an instance/object of the class.

A Static method can only access a static data like static variables, static methods.

Advantages of Static Variables and Methods:

--> Memory Efficiency
--> Global Access
--> Object Independence
--> Performance
--> Code Organization

Static Methods : Hiding

Nature of Static Methods:

--> Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance of the class.
--> This means they are shared among all instances of the class and can be called without creating an instance of class.

Method Hiding:

--> When a sub-class defines a static method with same signature as a static method in superclass, the method in subclass hides
    the one in the super class. This isn't same as overriding because:

    --> The hidden method in super class remains accessible, and it can be invoked if the superclass is specified explicitly.
    --> Static methods are bound at compile time based on the type of reference variable, not the object it points to at runtime.
        Hence, the method that gets called is determined by the type of reference, not by the runtime type of the object.
